APS105-Labs
===========

The code in this repository are my solutions to the lab exercises for the class APS105 at the University of Toronto. Feel free to use this code as reference (and hopefully it helps), however I will ask that you DO NOT copy the code directly as that is flat out plagiarism. Have fun coding!

Cheers,

Sean
